The easiest design for me was the square social media post with my quote, as it only included a few elements—a short quote and my name—and I kept it clean and minimalist. I applied branding elements such as consistent colors, fonts, and my personal logo to maintain a cohesive look. To ensure readability and hierarchy, I used a clear font for the quote, made it the focal point, and positioned my name smaller so the viewer’s attention naturally flowed from the main text to the signature. I also balanced spacing and alignment to make the design visually appealing. Through this project, I learned that simplicity can be very powerful in social media graphics, and that using consistent branding helps make your content recognizable. I also realized how important visual hierarchy is in guiding the viewer’s eye and delivering a clear message. Overall, creating these graphics taught me how to combine aesthetics with clarity to effectively communicate ideas.
