The design principle I found most useful was balance, as it helped me organize text, images, and icons in a visually appealing way across all five slides. In Canva, the easiest part was using templates and arranging elements, while the hardest part was customizing icons to make my slides unique and personal. Through this project, I learned that visual communication is about clarity and personality—colors, spacing, and imagery can quickly convey who you are. I also realized that small details, like consistent fonts and alignment, make a big difference in how professional and engaging a presentation looks. Overall, this project taught me how to combine creativity with organization to share information effectively.
