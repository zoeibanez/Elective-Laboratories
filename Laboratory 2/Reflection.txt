Reflection:
My branding was inspired by my personality—it reflects a sense of modernity and sophistication, 
with a playful pop of color that mirrors who I am. On the surface, I may appear serious and well-dressed, 
but those who get to know me see a bubbly, fun, and lively side that adds vibrancy to others’ lives. 
I chose my color palette because these hues are eye-catching and resonate with my personal style. 
One of the biggest challenges in creating the logo was designing something original and creative, 
especially given the constraints of pre-made icons. I wanted to transform them into something unique, 
something never seen before. The name BEEZI is inspired by my initials, BZI, and I wanted it to feel fresh, 
fun, and memorable. I plan to carry this branding—or draw inspiration from it—into future projects such as my 
portfolio and resume, ensuring a consistent and personal visual identity.
